Payment Tracking: Visual status indicators (Paid/Unpaid/Overdue) to keep track of monthly rental income.

Simple Authentication: Secure admin login to protect sensitive tenant data.

Thai Language Support: Entirely localized in Thai to provide the most comfortable experience for the primary user (my mother).
